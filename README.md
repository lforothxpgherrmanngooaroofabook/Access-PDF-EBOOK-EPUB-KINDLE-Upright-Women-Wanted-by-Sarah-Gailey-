A pity, because with such varied characters, the story could have been a great one. It misses that mark by quite a bit.

Title: Good, but I wanted more . . .
Date: Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2020
Review: As a premise, queer, gun-toting, librarians in a near future that resembles the old West? Yes and please and more, thank you very much.

In practice? There's moments of brilliance, one liners with enough punch to be poster quotes, but due to its length, so fast-paced as to make it difficult to connect with any character. (Ironic given that I was only in the mood to read something short, but there's got to be a balance to that kind of pacing).

But that feeling of being not right, straining against the spoken (and unspoken) limits of the society in which you live, that's as familiar as taking a breath. That shines through and that slow revelation when you shrug your shoulders and let it all fall away, that's what matters, what's real.

3.5 stars.

Title: A book without an ending
Date: Reviewed in the United States on September 20, 2021
Review: This must be Part One of a series, because it ended just about where it should have begun. This will always lead to a poor review from me.
The premise was interesting, but the prose and characterization read like 'gay propaganda' rather than a natural storyline. Esther had a girlfriend, so a transwoman named Cye appears as the obligatory Love Interest. Seemed contrived to me.
Also the use of the 'they' pronoun' is very awkward in print: I don't know if the author is referring to Cye, or to a group of women. When writing prose, you do not want to break the narrative flow and force your reader to try & figure out your meaning. We learned in Writer's Workshop that "your reader is deaf, dumb & blind and it is up to the writer to guide the reader seamlessly thru the story."
Anyway, this novel was too short and sketchy to make much of an impression, so off it goes to the 'delete' bin.

Review: Okay so hear me out: lesbian and non-binary gunslinging Librarians who are also spies and resistance fighters. That’s it. That’s the book. Well, not really. Taking place sometime in the future, Upright Women Wanted is set in an America that has devolved into a dictatorship version of the Wild West. The reader meets Esther, a woman who stowed away in a Librarian’s book wagon after she witnessed her lover be hanged for possession of unapproved materials. Esther quickly learns that there’s more to the Librarians than simply books and that she has a lot of training to do if she wishes to join their ranks.

Let me reiterate: lesbian and non-binary gunslinging Librarians who are also spies and resistance fighters. Literally, what is not to love about that? At fewer than 200 pages, this book was a really quick, REALLY fun read. Amazing plot, amazing characters, and an amazing setting.

Title: I love Sarah Gailey!
Date: Reviewed in the United States on February 15, 2020
Review: No one does westerns better than Sarah Gailey and this one includes even more of my favorite things! Librarians who travel the desert to take approved reading material to the masses, or a plot for resistance fighters? There’s bandits, a shoot out, characters who save the day and maybe fall in love. I really love tor novellas and I hope Gailey creates more in this world. The story isn’t done yet! It’s just as good as the American hippos series!
